Additionally, JRC has set minimum requirements for the required information in 2014 â€œThe European Fire Database Technical specifications and data submissionâ€.

149;Database for recording climate-related damages on cultural heritage;Several policies require such information, not least the Sendai-related reporting. These is no standardized way for reporting such information with the added challenge being the measuring of cultural value and consequent damage. The DALIH database aims at providing a uniform way of doing so with local input (from a competent authority or even citizen science) being a prerequisite). It can also be utilized for impact modelling validation;ECV: Extreme weather events and cultural heritage asset-level documentation of damage and cost estimate;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-39450-8_88;;;;;year;0.5;year;;Variables regarding the extreme weather events that affected the cultural heritage asset;100;10;m;;;;https://www.dalih.org/app/#/;The website is currently unavailable.
